# AgroMap Uzbekistan 🌍🌱  
A community-driven web app for smarter crop planning and better mapping of Uzbekistan's agricultural landscape.

## 🚀 Project Overview
Agriculture accounts for **1/5 of Uzbekistan's annual GDP**, yet farmers often make planting decisions **based on habit or past prices**, leading to oversupply of some crops and shortages of others.  

🚜 **AgroMap Uzbekistan** aims to **help farmers make informed planting decisions** using a **publicly sourced mapping system**. The app visualizes crop planting trends, predicts market prices, and allows users to **suggest map improvements** like street names and business locations.
