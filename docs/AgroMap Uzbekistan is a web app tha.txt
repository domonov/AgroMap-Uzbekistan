AgroMap Uzbekistan is a web app that collects information about what crop is planted and in how much area in Uzbekistan. With this project, I aim to help farmers make informed decisions as to what crop to plant in any given season. If they see that, say, potato is planted a lot in their region, they realize that they better plant something other than potato, since there is ample supply of potato in the market or will be. Now, farmers decide what crop to plant based on what they are accustomed to or what was in low supply the previous season. Little do they know, everyone planted that crop in this season because it was in low supply in the previous season and prices in the market reflected that. Since lots of farmers planted that crop, this upcoming season there will be oversupply and farmers lose on projected income. So, I want to have data on types of crops that have been planted and in how big an area, to extrapolate the amount of supply during harvesting, also predicted price. Since, my app asks for users to report their crops and the area, I currently don't have any initial data for launching the app. I am brainstorming how to obtain data on currently planted crops and their amount. One way I am thinking to get this data is to extract it from satellite pictures. I obtain new satellite pictures of the region and maybe apply ML models to identify the crop types and their area. Considering my thought process, what can you suggest? I am open to ideas. 

I am also planning to see if official data is published by government agencies in Uzbekistan.
Can you find out if this data is published by State Committee on Statistics and provide a link? Can you check if Ministry of Agriculture published or releases regional reports on planted areas and provide a link? Can you check if Farmers' association has planting data and provide a link to get it? Thank you.



1. Preferably national-level. However, whatever you can find.
2. Preferably current-year data. Historical data is also very important. So, whatever you can find.
3. Give me in their original language and also in English.




Your project concept is excellent and addresses a real market failure in agricultural planning! Here are several strategies to obtain initial crop data and build your platform:

## Immediate Data Sources (MVP Launch)

### 1. **Government Agricultural Statistics**
- **Uzbekistan State Committee on Statistics** publishes annual crop production data
- **Ministry of Agriculture** regional reports on planted areas
- **Farmers' associations** often have member planting data
- **Agricultural banks** (loan data correlates with crop planning)

### 2. **Partnerships with Agricultural Organizations**
- **Dehkan farms associations** - cooperatives with planting records
- **Agricultural extension services** - they track farmer activities
- **Seed/fertilizer suppliers** - sales data indicates planting intentions
- **Agricultural insurance companies** - crop insurance data

### 3. **Crowdsourced Bootstrap Strategy**
```
Phase 1: Target early adopters (progressive farmers, agricultural students)
Phase 2: Incentivize participation (free market reports, weather alerts)
Phase 3: Network effect as value becomes apparent
```

## Satellite Data & ML Approach

### Technical Implementation:
```python
# Satellite Data Sources
- Sentinel-2 (ESA) - Free, 10m resolution
- Landsat-8 (USGS) - Free, 30m resolution  
- Planet Labs - Commercial, daily 3m resolution
- Google Earth Engine - Processing platform

# ML Pipeline
1. Image preprocessing (cloud removal, atmospheric correction)
2. Crop classification (Random Forest, CNN, or Vision Transformers)
3. Area calculation using pixel counting
4. Temporal analysis for growth stage identification
```

### Crop Identification Strategy:
- **Spectral signatures** - Different crops have unique reflection patterns
- **Temporal patterns** - Planting/harvesting cycles vary by crop
- **Texture analysis** - Row crops vs. broadcast crops
- **Multi-season training** - Build models using known crop areas

## Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

### Year 1: Foundation
1. **Government data integration** for historical baselines
2. **Pilot partnerships** with 2-3 progressive farming cooperatives
3. **Simple satellite analysis** for major crops (wheat, cotton, rice)
4. **Manual ground truthing** with agricultural extension workers

### Year 2: Scale
1. **Advanced ML models** trained on Year 1 ground truth data
2. **Real-time satellite monitoring** for crop growth stages
3. **Expanded user base** through demonstrated value
4. **Regional partnerships** with agricultural universities

## Alternative Data Sources

### 1. **Mobile Data Collection**
- Partner with agricultural extension workers
- GPS-enabled smartphones for field surveys
- Photo-based crop identification apps

### 2. **Drone Partnerships**
- Agricultural service companies using drones
- University research programs
- Government monitoring initiatives

### 3. **Supply Chain Integration**
- Seed company sales data
- Fertilizer distribution records
- Grain elevator/processing facility intake data
- Transportation company crop movement data

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Data Foundation
```python
# Government API Integration
class GovernmentDataService:
    def fetch_historical_crop_data(self, region, year):
        # Integrate with Uzbekistan agricultural statistics
        pass
    
    def get_regional_planting_patterns(self, district):
        # Historical crop rotation data
        pass
```

### Phase 2 (Months 4-6): Satellite Pilot
```python
# Satellite Analysis Service
class SatelliteAnalyzer:
    def identify_crop_types(self, lat, lon, date_range):
        # ML model for crop classification
        pass
    
    def calculate_planted_area(self, polygon, crop_type):
        # Pixel-based area calculation
        pass
```

### Phase 3 (Months 7-12): ML Enhancement
```python
# Advanced Prediction Engine
class CropSupplyPredictor:
    def predict_harvest_volume(self, crop_type, region):
        # Satellite data + weather + historical yields
        pass
    
    def forecast_market_price(self, crop_type, harvest_date):
        # Supply prediction + demand modeling
        pass
```

## Funding & Partnership Strategy

### 1. **Government Grants**
- Digital agriculture initiatives
- Rural development programs
- Innovation funding

### 2. **International Organizations**
- World Bank agricultural development
- FAO digital agriculture programs
- USAID economic development

### 3. **Agricultural Companies**
- Seed companies (access to planting data)
- Equipment manufacturers (precision agriculture)
- Financial services (agricultural loans)

## Quick Win Strategy

Start with **one crop** (e.g., cotton - major in Uzbekistan) in **one region**:

1. **Partner with local cotton association** for historical data
2. **Use free Sentinel-2 data** for area mapping
3. **Validate with 10-20 farmers** through personal visits
4. **Build simple prediction model** based on area vs. price correlation
5. **Demonstrate value** to attract more users and partners

This approach minimizes risk while building proof of concept that can attract larger partnerships and funding.
