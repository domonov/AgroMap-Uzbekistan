### Perform Load Testing
- Enhanced load testing capabilities with concurrent user simulation
- Added performance benchmarks for homepage, API endpoints, map functionality, and database operations
- Implemented metrics collection for response times, throughput, and error rates

### Test All Features
- Created comprehensive feature tests covering user authentication, crop management, weather features, map functionality, analytics, and more
- Tests are now automated and can be run as part of the CI/CD pipeline

### Fix Reported Bugs
- Fixed various bugs identified during testing
- Improved error handling and logging for better debugging

### Test Mobile Support
- Added tests for responsive design and touch controls
- Verified mobile-specific features like offline support and touch gestures

### Validate Forms
