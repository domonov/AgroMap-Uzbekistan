## Component Interactions

### Request Flow

1. **Client Request**: User interacts with the application through a web browser or mobile device
2. **Routing**: Flask routes the request to the appropriate handler
3. **Authentication**: User authentication and authorization is verified
4. **Controller Processing**: The controller processes the request and calls appropriate services
5. **Business Logic**: Service layer executes business logic and data processing
6. **Data Access**: Data access layer retrieves or updates data in the database
7. **Response Rendering**: Controller passes data to templates for rendering
8. **Client Response**: Rendered HTML or JSON is returned to the client

### Asynchronous Processing

For long-running tasks, the application uses asynchronous processing:

1. **Task Initiation**: User or system initiates a task (e.g., generating a complex report)
2. **Task Queuing**: Task is added to a queue
3. **Background Processing**: Worker processes execute the task asynchronously
4. **Status Updates**: Task status is updated in the database
5. **Notification**: User is notified when the task is complete
