Based on your AgroMap Uzbekistan project, here's a professional resume description and highlights:

Project Description
AgroMap Uzbekistan (agroapp.uz) - A community-driven web application designed to help Uzbekistan's farmers make data-informed planting decisions and improve agricultural mapping. The platform visualizes crop distribution trends, provides market analysis, and enables crowdsourced map improvements for rural areas.

Project Highlights
• Developed full-stack web application using Flask (Python), SQLAlchemy, and Leaflet.js serving agricultural community needs

• Implemented multi-language support (Uzbek, Russian, English) with internationalization framework for 30+ million potential users

• Built interactive mapping system with real-time crop visualization, field boundary drawing, and geospatial data management

• Created RESTful API endpoints for crop reporting, market analysis, and crowdsourced map improvement suggestions

• Designed responsive mobile-first interface optimized for rural farmers using smartphones in field conditions

• Integrated external APIs for weather data, IP-based geolocation, and market price predictions

• Deployed production application with PostgreSQL database and custom domain (agroapp.uz)

• Implemented data analytics features including crop distribution statistics, trend analysis, and market recommendations

• Built collaborative mapping tools allowing users to suggest street names, building addresses, and business locations

• Addresses real economic impact - agriculture represents 20% of Uzbekistan's GDP with potential to reduce crop waste by 20%
